2. A database would be used when we would have multiple programs or instances
of a program trying to access or modify data. If only one instance of the program
is going to need the data, then we can just use a text file.

3. SQL is a declarative language and not a procedural language, which means that
we don't necessarily have to worry about how to access or modify data, we simply
use the commands in SQL and the SQL engine finds the most efficient way to
process the commands.

4. A database is essentially the information that is going to be used to make
our programs run. The programming that is done with high level languages tells
the program how to interact with the databases and when they come together, we
have functioning program.

5. Tables are the foundation of SQL databases and it is used to store groups
of information so that we can access it later on. Rows will store different
data types in the table and they are usually organized by an identifier.
Columns help organize the data types by their meaning, so you could have a column
of email addresses or a column of usernames. The values are the physical data
that gets stores in these rows and columns.
