6. <,>,<=,>=,!=,=, LIKE.
   We can use the greater than or less than comparisons if we are searching
   for a certain age group that is less or greater than an age. Similarly, the
   greater than or equal to and less than or equal to comparison operators can be
   used when we are searching for a specific weight that can include the weight
   and anything above or below it. For not equal to, we can use it to search for
   anything in the table that isn't equal to that value such as searching through
   a database of babies and only looking for the girl babies. Equal would be used
   if we are looking for an exact value, such as searching for a specific ID of
   a product. The LIKE and NOT LIKE comparison is used on strings if we are
   searching for a certain word or phrase, such as searching for a clothing brand.
